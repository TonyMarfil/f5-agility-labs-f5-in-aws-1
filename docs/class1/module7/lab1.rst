Clean Up Environment
--------------------

From the Super-NetOps terminal, run the handy lab-info utility. Confirm that "MCPD is up, System Ready" for all three of your instances.

.. code-block:: bash

   lab-info

.. attention ::
   
   Do not attempt to reset the Big-IP password until **MCPD is up, System Ready**.
